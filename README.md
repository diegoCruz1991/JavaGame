# How to Compile?
After clone this repository, go inside and make sure that you are at the same level as out and src folders

Note: This line is under Unix System, if you have Widows, follow the correct nomenclature

javac -d ./out -sourcepath src/main/java/ -cp out/ src/main/java/com/oca/app/App.java

After a successful compilation, you can run it!

java -cp ./out com.oca.app.App

Enjoy!
